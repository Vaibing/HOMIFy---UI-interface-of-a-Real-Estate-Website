# HOMIFy-UI/UX-Design-project-of-a-Real-Estate-Website
This project was created as part of a mini hackathon/workshop, where we were asked to develop a web application for listing real estate properties for sale or rent. Users should be able to add property listings, including photos and descriptions, and search for properties based on various criteria.
